### File Structure

Since this tool require the usage of water gas shitft research literatures in pdf format, 
the recommended file structure would be: 

.project/WGS-PDF1

.project/WGS-PDF2

... and so on.

In order to speed up development process, we recommend that the structure is followed, 
otherwise you can made changes with regards to the folder destination.

After the file structure has been set, install the relevant packages to this project by doing:
