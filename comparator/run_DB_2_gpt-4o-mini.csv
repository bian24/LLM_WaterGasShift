In the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, the Au/CeO2 catalyst can experience deactivation through several mechanisms, particularly under steady-state operation and during shutdown/start-up conditions. Here are the main deactivation mechanisms:

### Under Steady-State Conditions:

1. Sintering: This is a process where the gold nanoparticles on the ceria support coalesce to form larger particles during prolonged exposure to high temperatures, leading to a decrease in active surface area and, consequently, catalytic activity.

2. Poisoning: The presence of impurities in the reactants, such as sulfur compounds and other poisons, can adsorb on the catalyst surface, blocking active sites and diminishing catalyst effectiveness.

3. Coking: Carbon deposition can occur due to side reactions or the presence of hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of carbonaceous species that cover active sites and hinder catalytic performance.

4. Phase Changes of CeO2: The ceria support can undergo changes in its oxidation state and phase (e.g., from cubic to tetragonal) under reaction conditions, which may affect its interaction with gold and alter catalytic properties.

5. Leaching: Although less common for noble metals, under certain conditions, gold may leach from the support into the solution, reducing the amount of active metal available for the reaction.

### Under Shutdown/Start-Up Conditions:

1. Thermal Shock: Rapid changes in temperature during shutdown/start-up can lead to mechanical stress and fracture of the catalyst structure, causing deactivation.

2. Oxidation/Reduction Cycling: The cycling between oxidizing and reducing conditions can lead to changes in the oxidation state of both Au and CeO2, potentially impacting the catalyst's activity and stability.

3. Adsorption of Reaction By-Products: During shutdown, by-products might adsorb onto the catalyst, causing contamination of active sites, which can persist upon restart.

4. Hydration/Dehydration Effects: The presence of moisture or the removal of water vapor during startup conditions can alter the surface properties of the catalyst, impacting its performance.

To mitigate these deactivation mechanisms, careful control of operating conditions and catalyst regeneration strategies are often employed.",22. Under steady-state conditions,0.0,0.9592775426030714,0.7653929762656275

The properties of CuO/CeO2 catalysts for the high-temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction can be significantly influenced by changes in structural and lattice oxygen. Here’s a brief overview of how these changes can affect catalytic performance:

1. Structural Changes:
   - Particle Size & Morphology: Alterations in the structural arrangement of CuO and CeO2 can affect the particle size and shape, which directly influences the surface area and active sites available for the reaction. Smaller particles generally provide more active sites but may also lead to increased sintering at high temperatures.
   - Phase Composition: The presence of different valence states of copper (Cu(I) and Cu(II)) and various phases of ceria (CeO2, Ce2O3) can impact the electronic and catalytic properties. The stability of these phases under reaction conditions is crucial for long-term performance.

2. Lattice Oxygen Changes:
   - Oxygen Vacancy Formation: CeO2 is known for its ability to create oxygen vacancies, which can enhance its redox properties. Increased oxygen vacancies promote the activation of CO2 and water, leading to improved reaction rates in the WGS process.
   - Oxygen Mobility: High-temperature operation can enhance the mobility of lattice oxygen. Faster oxygen exchange rates can improve the overall kinetics of the reaction, allowing for better catalytic performance. This is especially important in the WGS reaction, where the transfer of oxygen is vital for the conversion of CO to CO2.
   - Oxidation/Reduction Cycles: The ability of CuO/CeO2 to undergo redox cycles involving lattice oxygen can enhance CO oxidation and improve the catalyst's efficiency. The balance between CuO reduction and re-oxidation during the WGS reaction significantly influences activity and selectivity.

3. Catalytic Activity and Stability:
   - The interplay between structural integrity and lattice oxygen dynamics can dictate the catalyst's activity. A catalyst that maintains its structure and oxygen dynamics under reaction conditions will likely exhibit greater stability and prolonged activity over time.
   - Deactivation may occur due to sintering, phase changes, or loss of active sites. Continuous optimization of the structural features and oxygen behavior is critical to ensure consistent WGS performance.
