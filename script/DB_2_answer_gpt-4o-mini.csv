"107. The preparation method typically used for catalysts like Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 promoted with Ni, Co, and K for studies such as the sour gas shift reaction often involves several steps, including impregnation, drying, and calcination. Here is a general outline of the procedure:

1. Support Preparation: γ-Al2O3 (gamma-alumina) is first prepared, usually by calcining aluminum hydroxide at high temperatures to achieve the desired surface area and pore structure.

2. Impregnation: The Re2O7 is usually introduced via an impregnation method, where the γ-Al2O3 support is treated with a solution containing a precursor of rhenium, such as ammonium perrhenate. The solution is typically allowed to soak into the support for a certain period, followed by evaporation of the solvent to leave behind the rhenium compound on the support.

3. Addition of Promoters: After the initial impregnation with rhenium, additional promoters (Ni, Co, and K) can be added through similar impregnation techniques using their respective precursors, such as nitrates or acetates. The supports are soaked in these solutions, and the excess liquid is removed.

4. Drying: After each impregnation step, the catalyst is dried, typically in an oven at moderate temperatures to remove water and solvents.

5. Calcination: Finally, the catalyst is calcined at elevated temperatures (commonly between 400-600 °C) in an air or inert atmosphere to convert the precursors into their active oxide forms and to enhance the interaction between the metal oxides and the support.

6. Reduction (if applicable): If the metals need to be in a reduced state for catalysis (as may be the case for Ni and Co), a reduction step may be necessary. This can be done using hydrogen at elevated temperatures.

This general method provides insight into a typical procedure for the preparation of promoted Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for catalysis studies, including the sour gas shift reaction. Specific details can vary based on the desired properties of the catalysts and experimental protocols."
