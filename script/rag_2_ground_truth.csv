1. The specific reaction rate of the Ir1/FeOx catalyst during the water gas shift reaction at 300 °C is 43.4 molco gIr−1 h−1.
2. The method combined a typical gold deposition/precipitation method with UV irradiation of the titania support suspended in ethanol.
3. La3+-doping of ceria enhances the water-gas shift reaction by increasing active intermediate concentrations and improving the reactivity of sites responsible for CO2 and H2 formation, thereby facilitating both "redox" and "associative" mechanisms depending on the support's chemical composition.
4. The 0.5 wt % Pt/Ce0.8Ti0.2O2−δ solid, with a Ti4+-doped CeO2 support, was found to be the most effective catalyst among those investigated.
5. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst showed the highest turnover frequency (TOF) and the lowest activation energy among the catalysts tested for the single stage water-gas shift reaction.
6. Ti impregnation over the ZrO2 support increased the surface area, Pt dispersion, and reducibility, leading to a significantly enhanced CO conversion. The reaction rate of Pt/Ti[20]/ZrO2 increased by a factor of about 3 compared to the bare Pt/ZrO2 catalyst.
7. The modified co-precipitation method improved the Cu surface area by using a mixture of water and ethylene glycol as a solvent, adjusting the pH and temperatures of the precursor solution, and reversing the order of adding the precipitating agent to the metal precursor solution. This led to the formation of aurichalcite, which produced smaller Cu particles compared to the conventional co-precipitation method.
8. The 20% Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity in the water-gas shift reaction, exhibiting above 90% CO conversion after activation in 5% H2 - 95% Ar mixture at 300°C.
9. Both CuCeTi and CuCe catalysts produced significant amounts of H2 during the water-gas shift reaction, favoring a H2/CO ratio close to 2, with CuCeTi demonstrating better performance overall compared to CuCe or CuTi.
10. The addition of Nb2O5 promotes the formation of mobile electronic carriers, enhances reducibility, and increases CO adsorption capacity, improving the catalytic activity of CuO/CeO2. The catalyst with 1 wt.% Nb2O5 shows the best performance due to these enhancements, while excessive Nb2O5 can disrupt the interaction between CuO and CeO2, leading to inferior catalytic activity.
