1. The specific reaction rate of the Ir1/FeOx catalyst during the water gas shift reaction at 300 °C is 43.4 molco gIr−1 h−1.
2. The method combined a typical gold deposition/precipitation method with UV irradiation of the titania support suspended in ethanol.
3. La3+-doping of ceria enhances the water-gas shift reaction by increasing active intermediate concentrations and improving the reactivity of sites responsible for CO2 and H2 formation, thereby facilitating both "redox" and "associative" mechanisms depending on the support's chemical composition.
