"1. The specific reaction rate of the Ir1/FeOx catalyst during the water gas shift reaction at 300 °C is reported to be significantly high, showing an activity that is one order of magnitude greater than that of cluster or nanoparticle counterparts. According to the findings of Lin et al. (2013), this single-atom catalyst exhibits an activity that surpasses even the most active Au- or Pt-based catalysts. Unfortunately, the exact numerical value of the specific reaction rate at this temperature is not provided in the available references. However, the emphasis is on the remarkable performance of the Ir1/FeOx catalyst, indicating its potential for high efficiency in hydrogen production applications."

"2. The method used to stabilize isolated gold atoms on titania for catalyzing the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction involved a combination of a typical gold deposition/precipitation method along with UV irradiation of the titania support that was suspended in ethanol. This innovative approach facilitated the creation of Au−O−TiOx sites, which enabled the facile dissociation of H2O, thereby promoting the catalytic activity of the isolated gold atoms. The study indicated that achieving a loading of approximately 1 wt% of isolated gold atoms resulted in effective catalysis for the reaction."

"3. La3+-doping of ceria (CeO2) has significant effects on the mechanism and kinetics of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction when using platinum (Pt) supported on Ce1−xLaxO2−δ catalysts. Here are the key points regarding these effects:

1. Chemical Composition and Surface Characteristics: La3+-doping alters the chemical composition and enhances the surface properties of the ceria support. This modification influences the electronic structure and redox properties of the ceria, which is crucial for its role in the WGS reaction.

2. Surface Concentration of Active Intermediates: The presence of La3+ ions affects the surface concentration of active reaction intermediates involved in the WGS mechanism. The study indicates that both the H-path (involving hydrogen formation) and the C-path (involving carbon monoxide oxidation) are influenced by the concentration of these intermediates, which can lead to changes in the reaction kinetics.

3. Extent of Reaction Zone: La3+-doping alters the extent of the reaction zone around each Pt nanoparticle. This change can enhance the interaction between the ceria support and the platinum nanoparticles, thereby facilitating the reaction pathways and improving the overall catalytic activity.

4. Mechanistic Pathway: The doping influences the prevailing mechanism of the WGS reaction, shifting it between redox and associative pathways. The redox mechanism generally involves the transfer of oxygen from the support to adsorbed CO, while the associative mechanism may involve the formation of surface intermediates such as formate. The variation in the mechanism is dictated by the dopant's effects on the electronic properties of the ceria support.

5. Kinetic Parameters: The kinetic parameters, such as the surface concentration of the H-pool (a crucial factor in determining reaction rates), are significantly affected by La3+-doping. The altered surface characteristics contribute to enhanced catalytic performance, suggesting that La3+-doping leads to increased activity and potentially improved selectivity for hydrogen production during the WGS reaction.

In summary, La3+-doping of ceria in Pt/Ce1−xLaxO2−δ catalysts plays a pivotal role in modifying the reaction mechanism and kinetics of the water-gas shift reaction, leading to enhanced catalytic activity through modifications in chemical composition, active intermediate concentration, and the mechanistic pathway."

"4. The most effective support composition for the water-gas shift reaction in Pt/Ce1−xTixO2−δ catalysts was identified to be with a Ce/Ti ratio of 0.5. This specific ratio optimizes the catalytic performance by enhancing the activity of the platinum nanoparticles supported on ceria-titania. The research indicated that the Ce1−xTixO2−δ supports synthesized by the citrate sol-gel method exhibited varying degrees of catalytic activity depending on the Ce/Ti ratio, and the ratio of 0.5 provided the best results in terms of reaction kinetics and product yield. This can be attributed to the improved redox properties and structural stability of the supported catalysts at this composition, which are critical factors in facilitating the water-gas shift reaction."
