These characteristics contribute to maintaining high CO conversion levels and catalyst stability over extended reaction times, making them effective for use in hydrogen production.
61. Mg(Al)O mixed metal oxide serves as an excellent support for Cu nanoparticles in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction due to its ability to form a solid solution with the Cu component, resulting in highly dispersed and uniform Cu nanoparticles. The support provides structural stability and resistance against sintering, which are crucial for maintaining catalyst activity and longevity. Additionally, the high dispersion of Cu nanoparticles on Mg(Al)O enhances the available active surface area, thereby increasing the WGS activity compared to traditional supports like ZnO/Al2O3. This results in a catalyst system that exhibits superior hydrogen production efficiency and stability.
62. The aging environment significantly influences the performance of Pd-based catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction. A lean-only gas environment results in less deterioration of catalyst activity compared to rich-only and redox environments, which cause severe loss of metal dispersion and catalytic activity. Pd can redisperse under dry lean conditions, such as 700°C air exposure, which helps restore catalytic function by forming PdO, allowing it to spread and fragment into smaller particles. This redispersion is particularly effective for Pd supported on La-Al2O3 and Ce-ZrO2 oxides, enhancing catalyst activity by restoring the metal-support interface sites needed for efficient CO conversion. This insight can inform engine control strategies to periodically regenerate catalysts and maintain their performance.

68. Alkali promoters, such as sodium, modify the electronic structure of formate species by weakening the C–H bond, facilitating its decomposition. This leads to enhanced activity of Pt/silica catalysts in the water-gas shift and steam-assisted formic acid decomposition reactions. A normal kinetic isotope effect was observed for both reactions, with a decrease in magnitude upon Na-doping, suggesting formate C–H bond breaking as the rate-limiting step in an associative mechanism. The alkali dopants also promote the formation of reactive OH groups, aiding the catalytic cycle without producing stable carbonates that could suppress it.
69. The Ni-doped mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic performance for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction, with CO conversion of 93% and 47% H2 yield at 280 °C. This enhanced activity is attributed to the smaller crystallite size (8.6 nm) of the catalyst and the strong interaction between Co and Ni, which leads to higher reducibility of Co3O4 and increased oxygen vacancy concentration on the catalyst surface.
70. Potassium doping enhances the catalytic activity and stability of mesoporous Pd/TiO2 catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction by increasing the dispersion of Pd and preventing sintering of Pd particles. The alkali metal promotes electron transfer, stabilizing Pd in a partially oxidized state and creating more surface hydroxyl groups, which are beneficial for the reaction. Additionally, potassium suppresses methanation, leading to higher selectivity toward the water-gas shift reaction.
71. Doping Ru/AC catalysts with potassium salts, particularly K2CO3, significantly enhances their catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The presence of potassium salts decreases the reduction temperature of RuOx, weakens the interaction between RuOx and the support, and increases the local concentration of water around active sites due to the hygroscopic nature of potassium salts. This improved interaction between Ru and reactant molecules (CO and H2O) leads to higher catalytic activity. Additionally, the method of potassium salt incorporation affects catalyst activity, with post-treatment of pre-formed Ru/AC being more effective than pre-treatment of the carbon support with K2CO3.
72. The addition of cobalt to Cu-CeO2 catalysts enhances the structural properties and catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction by forming Co2O3 and Co3O4 species, which provide additional CO adsorption sites. This modification increases CO conversion and the thermal stability of the catalyst. Additionally, the presence of cobalt increases Lewis and Brønsted acid site densities, facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO and H2 molecules, resulting in improved catalytic activity.
73. Bimetallic Pt/M/CeZrO4 catalysts (where M includes Na, Mo, Sn, Cu, Zn) offer benefits over monometallic Pt/CeZrO4 catalysts for the low temperature water-gas shift reaction by reducing methanation, leading to higher hydrogen selectivity. These bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn/CeZrO4 and Pt/Na/CeZrO4, demonstrated similar or better CO conversion yet had higher hydrogen selectivity because less CO and hydrogen were consumed in methane production. Additionally, introducing a second metal helps to enhance catalyst performance, potentially by modifying electronic properties, stability, and interaction with the support.

- The α-MoC substrate helps in achieving high dispersion and altered electronic structure of the supported Au, which facilitates favorable bonding with CO and efficient activation of water at low temperatures.
- The Au/α-MoC catalyst shows remarkable stability up to 473 K without oxidation of α-MoC or aggregation of Au.
- Synergistic interactions between Au and adjacent Mo sites on α-MoC facilitate low-temperature water activation and subsequent CO reactions with surface hydroxyl groups, leading to exceptional catalytic performance.
75. The main advantage of using non-thermal plasma activation for the water-gas shift reaction in this study is that it allows the reaction to occur at low temperatures, overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, while maintaining high catalytic activity. This is achieved through structural changes in the gold-based catalyst that do not occur with traditional thermal activation, leading to a weakening of the AuCO bond and an alternative reaction pathway.
76. Gold (Au) is used in catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction due to its ability to enhance catalytic activity, particularly under non-thermal plasma activation conditions. It facilitates the reaction at lower temperatures by undergoing structural changes that lead to a weakening of the AuCO bond, promoting an alternative reaction pathway and maintaining high catalytic efficiency.
77. Pd single atoms in the Pd/FeOx catalyst enhance the reducibility of FeOx and facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which serve as active sites for promoting the dissociation of H2O into H2 and atomic O. These atomic oxygen species readily react with CO adsorbed on Pd single-atom sites, promoting a redox mechanism that results in low activation energy and high catalytic efficiency.
78. The dispersion of Pd species as single atoms in Pd/FeOx catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The high dispersion increases the turnover frequency due to the increased availability of active sites. Single-atom dispersion weakens the CO adsorption, promoting its reaction with H2O and leading to higher atomic efficiency and a lower activation energy, compared to larger Pd clusters or nanoparticles.
79. Citric acid (CA) acts as a chelating agent that promotes the dispersion of platinum (Pt) on the support in Pt-based catalysts. By chelating with Pt ions, CA helps maintain the separation of Pt atoms, preventing agglomeration during the drying process. This results in better distribution of Pt on the support, leading to enhanced dispersion and smaller Pt nanoparticle sizes. The improved dispersal of Pt allows for more active catalytic sites, better thermal stability, and enhanced catalytic performance, particularly in eliminating pollutants in vehicle exhaust.
80. Ni/Mo/TiO2 offers several advantages over Co/Mo/Al2O3 in the water-gas shift reaction. Ni/Mo/TiO2 operates effectively at lower temperatures, with reaction starting temperatures below 200°C, compared to Co/Mo/Al2O3, which starts above 250°C. Ni/Mo/TiO2 also achieves higher CO conversions under low steam-to-CO ratios, showing a maximum CO conversion at a H2O/CO ratio of 1.2 mol/mol. Furthermore, Ni/Mo/TiO2 exhibits greater sulfur tolerance and higher activity for COS conversion and HCN decomposition, making it more efficient under industrial coal gasification conditions with low steam and high sulfur content. Additionally, Ni/Mo/TiO2 requires less catalyst quantity to achieve similar conversions when compared to Co/Mo/Al2O3, making it more economical.
81. The benefit of using a copper supported on zeolite 13X hybrid material for the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) lies in its ability to enhance the reaction by capturing CO2 in situ, known as sorption enhanced water-gas shift reaction (SE-WGSR). This process maximizes hydrogen production by shifting equilibrium to favor more CO conversion through CO2 removal during the reaction. The Cu-zeolite 13X hybrid material exhibits high catalytic activity, achieving up to 95% CO conversion, and during SE-WGSR tests, it resulted in higher concentrations of hydrogen, with improvements noticed in both transient and steady-state operation. The material effectively integrates reaction and separation, resulting in more efficient hydrogen production at low temperatures.
82. The Ni/Mo/TiO2 catalyst enhances the efficiency of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process with CO2 capture by operating effectively at low temperatures and low steam-to-CO ratios. This sulfur-tolerant catalyst allows for reduced steam usage in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, thus preserving more steam for power generation in the steam turbine. As a result, the catalyst contributes to an improvement in net thermal efficiency. The study found that when the Ni/Mo/TiO2 catalyst was applied, the net thermal efficiency improved by 0.8 percentage points compared to higher steam requirements, achieving a net efficiency of 40.0% (HHV). This efficiency improvement makes the catalyst highly suitable for integration into IGCC systems with carbon capture, as it enhances power production while minimizing CO2 emissions.
83. The size of Pt has a significant impact on its catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction when supported on FeOx. Pt single-atoms (Pt-SAC) on FeOx show significantly higher specific activity and turnover frequency (TOF) compared to Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP). Pt-SACs have a lower activation energy (33 kJ/mol), facilitating a more efficient "redox" mechanism where CO reacts with oxygen generated from H2O dissociation at the oxygen vacancies of FeOx, promoting higher CO conversion rates. In contrast, Pt-NP exhibits a stronger CO adsorption and higher activation energy, favoring an "associative" mechanism where CO reacts with OH groups formed from H2O activation, leading to the formation and decomposition of formate intermediates, resulting in simultaneous production of H2 and CO2 but with reduced activity and greater energy demand. The study highlights Pt-SACs as highly active for WGS due to their ability to effectively catalyze through a "redox" pathway and achieve superior conversion performance even at low Pt loadings.
84. Varying the Cu content in Cu-Fe3O4 catalysts significantly affects their performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. The study finds an optimal Cu-Fe ratio, with Cu0.3Fe0.7Ox exhibiting the highest catalytic activity due to enhanced Cu dispersion and strong Cu-Fe interactions. This leads to increased active surface area and better reducibility, facilitating higher CO adsorption and conversion rates. An excessive amount of Cu results in sintering and deactivation, reducing catalyst stability and performance. Conversely, low Cu content results in insufficient active sites and too strong CO adsorption, also lowering WGS activity. Thus, optimizing Cu content is critical for balancing active phase availability with catalyst stability, achieving high WGS activity at low temperatures. The addition of Fe improves catalyst reducibility and stability, enhancing WGS performance by promoting desired adsorptive and reductive properties on the catalyst surface.

The plasma treatment, in combination with hydrogen reduction, produced catalysts with superior activity compared to conventional treatments.
90. The new catalyst design concept proposed for the WGS reaction involves using a physical mixture of a traditional WGS catalyst (such as those based on Cu, Pt, or Au) with an ionic conductor. The role of the ionic conductor is to enhance the catalyst's performance by facilitating the dissociation and transport of water, thereby improving the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This is achieved through the ionic conductor's ability to act as an active water species supplier, leveraging proton conductivity via the Grotthuss mechanism to improve the overall water activation.
91. Yttrium doping in Au/CeO2 catalysts increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies and enhances oxygen ion mobility, which can improve the ionic conductivity and catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction. However, excessive yttrium (beyond a certain limit) can lead to reduced surface ionic conductivity and hinder oxygen ion mobility due to vacancy ordering. For lightly yttrium-doped catalysts (1 and 2.5 mass% Y2O3), increased oxygen mobility correlates with higher catalytic activity, as demonstrated by better CO conversion, particularly in catalysts prepared by impregnation.
92. The choice of precipitant significantly impacts the structural properties, Pt dispersion, and catalytic activity of the pt/0.1Al-0.9Ce catalysts. NH4OH as a precipitant resulted in catalysts with the highest CO oxidation activity, largest oxygen vacancy, and highest Pt dispersion. Catalysts prepared with hydroxide-form precipitants (e.g., NH4OH, KOH, NaOH) showed better catalytic performance than those prepared with carbonate-form precipitants (e.g., K2CO3, Na2CO3) due to better Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility. The study concluded that the catalytic activity was closely related to the oxygen vacancy and Pt dispersion, with NH4OH being identified as the most effective precipitant under the experimental conditions.
93. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst prepared using the Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) method exhibited superior performance in the water-gas shift reaction compared to a catalyst made from commercial ceria nanopowder. The SAS-derived catalyst had a higher reducibility, more oxygen vacancies, and better platinum dispersion, leading to higher CO conversion rates. The different nanoparticle shape and size modulation through the SAS method likely resulted in enhanced catalytic properties due to improved support-metal interaction and increased oxygen storage capacity. These factors contributed to the SAS-derived catalyst demonstrating optimal performance, particularly at temperatures above 280°C.
94. The Ce0.6Y0.4O2-supported platinum catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction due to several factors:
- High Reducibility: The introduction of yttria (Y2O3) into the CeO2 lattice increases the reducibility of the support, enhancing oxygen mobility and facilitating the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the water-gas shift reaction.
- Oxygen Vacancy Creation: The Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support has a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, providing more reactive sites for the reaction and improving the reducibility and catalytic performance at low temperatures.
- Improved Interaction and Redox Properties: The interaction between Pt and the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support improves the redox properties of the catalyst, favoring the formation of active hydroxyl groups, which are essential for enhancing the activity of the water-gas shift reaction.
- Reduction in CO Adsorption Strength: The Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst reduces the strength of CO adsorption, preventing blockage of active sites and thereby improving the rate of reaction and overall catalytic activity. These factors together contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst compared to Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 catalysts, which exhibit lower reducibility and fewer oxygen vacancies.
95. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated superior water-gas shift activity compared to other mono-metallic PGM catalysts supported on CeO2 and TiO2. It exhibited higher CO conversion rates and showed no methanation below 300°C, making it more desirable for fuel processing. In contrast, Rh-based catalysts, like Rh/TiO2 and Rh/CeO2, led to significant methanation, making them less suitable. Although Pt/CeO2 showed excellent initial activity, it deactivated substantially over time, indicating a need for further development to improve stability for commercial applications. Lower Pt loadings yielded higher specific metal activity, which is beneficial for cost efficiency.
96. The synthesis method used was co-precipitation.
97. Yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) is used as a dopant in Au/CeO₂ catalysts to modify the ceria support, enhancing oxygen vacancy formation and improving the catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction. However, an increase in Y₂O₃ content may hinder oxygen mobility due to the ordering of surface vacancies near segregated Y³⁺ ions, affecting catalyst activity.
98. The synthesis method used was a metal-organic framework (MOF) templated approach. This involved the formation of CuCe-BTC MOF followed by a two-step heat treatment to produce nanoporous Cu/CeO₂ nanostructures.
99. The optimal aging conditions for the synthesis of Al₂O₃ supported Cu-Zn catalysts using co-precipitation were an aging temperature of 80°C and an aging time of 72 hours. These conditions resulted in the highest CO conversion and very stable catalytic activity, attributed to high surface area and an almost complete degree of CuO reduction.

This leads to improved catalytic performance and prolonged catalyst life under reaction conditions.
102. Manganese doping in inverse CeO₂/CuO catalysts enhances their performance in the water-gas shift reaction by influencing the characteristics of supported ceria particles. This doping reduces the size of ceria particles and increases their reducibility, thereby enhancing water activation and the generation of active intermediates. These changes lead to a higher intrinsic activity of the catalytically active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction.
103. In the Pt/γ-Mo₂N catalyst, molybdenum species on the catalyst surface largely exist as molybdenum oxide (MoO₃). This surface MoO₃ is highly reducible even at room temperature and transforms into highly distorted MoOx species during the water-gas shift reaction, which significantly contributes to the catalyst's activity and stability. The interaction and transformation of these molybdenum species on the surface are crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction.
104. Noble metals supported on binary γ-Al₂O₃-α-Ga₂O₃ oxide show varying performances in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction, with Pd/AlGa exhibiting the highest catalytic activity among the tested catalysts. Despite Pt/AlGa demonstrating the highest metal dispersion, the presence of isolated palladium species on the Pd/AlGa catalyst, which are electronically less saturated and more active, is believed to contribute significantly to its superior performance. Therefore, the catalytic activity in this system is less dependent on metal dispersion and more influenced by the presence of isolated active metal species.
105. Lanthana modification in Pt/La(x)/HAP catalysts enhances several properties critical for the water-gas shift reaction. The addition of lanthana increases oxygen storage capacity, inhibits the incorporation of Pt into the HAP framework, promotes reducibility, and results in smaller Pt particle sizes. These changes improve the catalysts' activity and stability. The Pt/La(x)/HAP catalysts show high resistance to shut-down/start-up cycles due to these modifications, making them suitable for potential mobile device applications. The reaction demonstrated similarities to the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in terms of reaction orders, suggesting that lanthana introduction enhances kinetics akin to non-reducible supports.
106. The Y-modified ceria supports were synthesized by the co-precipitation method.
107. The Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by consecutive incipient wetness impregnation followed by drying at 105°C and calcination at 450°C.
108. The bimetallic Cu−Pd nanoparticles were synthesized using a liquid-phase chemical coreduction route, where Cu and Pd were coreduced simultaneously in a colloidal solution with CTAB as a surfactant and capping agent.
109. The Cu−Pd nanoparticles were prepared by the same colloidal chemical coreduction technique as described in the experimental methods section of the study. These nanoparticles were synthesized separately for high-resolution energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron microscopy studies.
110. The Mo, W, and Re-based catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, where Mo, W, and Re were deposited as the first component on γ-Al2O3 support. The samples were then dried at 105°C for 16 hours and calcined at 450°C for 2 hours. Nickel or cobalt was added as a second component, while potassium was introduced as a second or third component over the calcined one- and bi-component samples.
