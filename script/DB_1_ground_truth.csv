The experimental CO conversions reported were successfully predicted by the ANN when trained on data excluding unique variables from individual publications.
12. Au/HAP exhibited high WGS activity compared to Ru/HAP. Notably, Ru/HAP showed methanation activity at temperatures above 300°C due to CO dissociative chemisorption, which could be suppressed by increasing the partial pressure of water under reaction conditions.

14. Gold is primarily present as isolated Au3+ atoms in the as-prepared Au/CeZrO4 catalysts, leading to higher WGS activity due to a higher proportion of gold in this oxidation state.
15. Au/CeZrO4 shows a 60-80°C advantage in CO conversion over Pt/CeZrO4. This is because Au effectively activates H2O to oxidize reduced Ce sites at lower temperatures, leading to hydrogen generation.

28. Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 exhibits higher CO conversion, greater stability, higher Pt dispersion, easier reducibility, and a lower activation energy compared to Pt/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2. This enhancement is attributed to the cubic phase of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, which provides better oxygen storage capacity and facilitates the reaction.
29. Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 is considered promising due to its high intrinsic activity, CO conversion at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV), and 100% selectivity towards CO2 above 240°C, making it suitable for compact reformers requiring high-performance catalysts.

31. The Pt-promoted HfO2 exhibited higher intensity formate bands compared to unpromoted HfO2, suggesting that Pt facilitates the formation of reduced defect sites (active bridging OH groups) which react with CO to generate formates.
32. The Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared using an alumina sol–gel process combined with impregnation of an aqueous Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 solution and a 0.01 mol/l aqueous platinum nitrate solution.
33. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited lower byproduct formation, including methane and C2+ hydrocarbons, compared to the Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst at 45 bars, which may be attributed to the less acidic nature of ceria.
34. Alkali ions, such as sodium or potassium, activated platinum adsorbed on alumina or silica by stabilizing surface OH groups. These groups, in association with atomically dispersed platinum, catalyzed the low-temperature WGS reaction. The active site was identified as a partially oxidized Pt-alkali-Ox(OH)y species.

38. The addition of nickel to Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts enhances the catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. Increasing the nickel content shifts the carbon monoxide conversion-temperature curve towards lower reaction temperatures, indicating improved activity.
39. No detectable methane formation was observed during the catalytic reaction tests conducted with Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts under idealized conditions, indicating high selectivity of the catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction.

41. Alkali promotion significantly enhances the water–gas shift activity of Pt/TiO2 catalysts by creating active sites at the metal-support interface, with an optimal alkali content (such as Na:Pt = 1:1) leading to an intrinsic activity about three times higher than the unpromoted catalyst.
42. The proposed mechanism for the water-gas shift reaction on Pt supported on ceria-based solids is a formate associative mechanism. This involves the interaction of CO adsorbed on Pt with terminal OH groups on partially reduced ceria to form formate intermediates, which then decompose to produce CO2 and H2.
43. H2S leads to a slight decline in CO conversion over Pt/CeO2 catalysts, but the catalysts retain high activity and exhibit excellent stability even with 20 ppm H2S, typical for IGCC syngas levels. The conversion was stable around 73% for a 300-hour test at 673K, indicating that after an initial decline, deactivation levels off.
44. The presence of H2S decreases the activity of Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts, with the extent of deactivation increasing with higher H2S concentrations. However, this deactivation is reversible, and catalytic activity can be largely restored when the catalysts are exposed to a reducing atmosphere without H2S.
45. The incorporation of ZrO2 into the catalyst system improved the structural properties, preventing Au particles agglomeration, leading to smaller, more uniformly distributed Au particles, thus enhancing the catalytic performance for the MT-WGS reaction. The 3% Au-CeO2 + ZrO2 catalyst achieved equilibrium conditions at about 400°C.
46. Pt–Ce/C catalysts are more active than Pt/Ce catalysts at higher temperatures (around 623K), achieving up to 90% CO conversion, while Pt/Ce catalysts achieve only 70% conversion, indicating the advantage of dispersing ceria on activated carbon for greater efficacy.
47. The proposed mechanism suggests that Pt promotes hydrogen spillover, which may interfere with H2S adsorption at oxygen vacancy sites on CeO2. This could preserve the accessibility of these sites for H2O, leading to a dynamic equilibrium of OH and SH groups. As a result, the catalytic activity of the ceria surface may be maintained in the vicinity of Pt centers, even in the presence of H2S.

49. In the realistic reformate stream, the 3% Au-CeO2 + ZrO2 catalyst achieved close to equilibrium conversion at approximately 400°C, whereas the 3% Au-CeO2 + Al2O3 did not reach equilibrium conversion and showed a maximum conversion of 37% at 330°C.
50. The Ru/V2O3 catalyst demonstrated high activity for the water gas shift reaction without producing methane when reduced at 400°C.
51. The concentration of surface formates increases with higher ceria surface area, indicating that catalysts with higher formate concentrations after CO addition show improved activities under steady state water-gas shift conditions.
52. The metal (Pt) catalyzes the reduction of the surface shell of ceria, producing active geminal OH groups on partially reduced ceria for the water-gas shift reaction, while bulk ceria is affected very little, if at all.

54. The activity and stability of the Pt/Ce0.56Zr0.44O2 catalysts were influenced by the preparation method, the type of platinum precursor used (nitrate or chloride), pretreatment atmosphere, and sintering or embedding of platinum by the support.
55. During durability testing, SCS catalysts showed deactivation due to sintering and carbonate formation, but their activity was largely recoverable upon regeneration. In contrast, the IWI catalyst made from nitrate precursors exhibited irreversible deactivation, while the IWI catalyst from chloride precursors showed a gain in activity after durability testing.

60. Pt/TiO2 catalysts were more active than both Pt/SiO2 and Pt/CeO2. The WGS reaction on Pt/TiO2 was catalyzed via a bifunctional metal-support mechanism, with Pt promoting the reduction of Ti4+ ions to Ti3+, creating oxygen vacancies for efficient water activation.
61. On Pt/CeO2 catalysts, Pt increased the concentration of OH groups by enhancing the reduction extent of ceria and provided a faster pathway for the formation of formate intermediates, contributing to a bifunctional metal-support mechanism for the WGS reaction.
62. Among CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts, Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu combinations were found to show strong synergetic promoting effects in the OWGS reaction.
63. The presence of Pd in Pd–Cu/CeO2 increases the number of active sites for H2O dissociation and suppresses H2 activation, thereby improving the catalyst’s activity in OWGS.
64. The Pd–Cu/CeO2 catalyst forms a well-mixed Pd–Cu alloy with highly dispersed Pd in Cu, which facilitates strong metal-metal interactions and enhances the OWGS activity compared to Pt–Cu/CeO2, where Pt is less miscible with Cu.
65. Doping ceria with Ca2+ enhances oxygen mobility and ceria reducibility by straining the lattice, which improves the mobility of O-bound intermediates like formates. This leads to faster migration and decomposition of intermediates, resulting in higher LT-WGS rates and turnover frequencies (TOFs).
66. Ca-doping causes a shift in diffraction peaks towards higher 2θ values and broadens the peaks, indicating lattice strain and reduction in crystallite size. This suggests successful incorporation of Ca into the ceria lattice, affecting its structure.
67. 0.5% Pt/Ca0.50Ce0.50O1.5 displays higher CO conversion and specific rates during LT-WGS than 0.5% Pt/CeO2, indicating enhanced catalytic performance. The improvement is attributed to increased oxygen mobility and surface intermediate mobility due to Ca-doping, which facilitates better interaction at the Pt-ceria interface.

76. It is proposed that dopants enhance the reducibility by increasing the oxygen ion mobility in the ceria lattice, which facilitates oxygen transfer from the ceria to the metal, thereby affecting the surface oxygen atoms' mobility and reactivity.
77. The mixed oxide supports were prepared by coprecipitation, where aqueous solutions of metal salts were mixed, and then ammonia was added to form a precipitate, which was filtered, washed, and calcined.
78. Oxygen vacancies are thought to enhance the reducibility of the support and improve catalytic activity by facilitating oxygen mobility, which is beneficial for both the redox and associative mechanisms of the WGS reaction.
79. Doping ceria with Zr resulted in smaller particle sizes and increased surface areas, which contributed to the enhanced reducibility and potentially higher catalytic activity for the WGS reaction.
80. The addition of 3 wt% Na to the Pt/TiO2 catalyst significantly improves the water gas shift activity and stability compared to unmodified Pt/TiO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. Na helps in inhibiting Pt particle sintering, enhancing the catalyst's performance.
81. The Pt–3Na/TiO2 catalyst is stable at reaction temperatures higher than 250°C. At lower temperatures, it exhibits deactivation, likely due to the buildup of surface carbonate or formate species. However, increasing the temperature back above 250°C restores the catalyst's activity.

This approach allows for a better understanding of their interactions and relative significance by processing these variables separately while using them together in the model.
