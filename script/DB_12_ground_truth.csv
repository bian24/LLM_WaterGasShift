The experimental CO conversions reported were successfully predicted by the ANN when trained on data excluding unique variables from individual publications.
12. Au/HAP exhibited high WGS activity compared to Ru/HAP. Notably, Ru/HAP showed methanation activity at temperatures above 300°C due to CO dissociative chemisorption, which could be suppressed by increasing the partial pressure of water under reaction conditions.
13. These catalysts are reversible in cyclic reduction–oxidation treatments, stable up to 400°C, non-pyrophoric, and show high activity and stability, making them suitable for hydrogen generation in fuel cells.
14. Gold is primarily present as isolated Au3+ atoms in the as-prepared Au/CeZrO4 catalysts, leading to higher WGS activity due to a higher proportion of gold in this oxidation state.
15. Au/CeZrO4 shows a 60-80°C advantage in CO conversion over Pt/CeZrO4. This is because Au effectively activates H2O to oxidize reduced Ce sites at lower temperatures, leading to hydrogen generation.

28. Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 exhibits higher CO conversion, greater stability, higher Pt dispersion, easier reducibility, and a lower activation energy compared to Pt/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2. This enhancement is attributed to the cubic phase of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, which provides better oxygen storage capacity and facilitates the reaction.
29. Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 is considered promising due to its high intrinsic activity, CO conversion at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV), and 100% selectivity towards CO2 above 240°C, making it suitable for compact reformers requiring high-performance catalysts.

31. The Pt-promoted HfO2 exhibited higher intensity formate bands compared to unpromoted HfO2, suggesting that Pt facilitates the formation of reduced defect sites (active bridging OH groups) which react with CO to generate formates.
32. The Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared using an alumina sol–gel process combined with impregnation of an aqueous Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 solution and a 0.01 mol/l aqueous platinum nitrate solution.
33. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited lower byproduct formation, including methane and C2+ hydrocarbons, compared to the Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst at 45 bars, which may be attributed to the less acidic nature of ceria.
34. Alkali ions, such as sodium or potassium, activated platinum adsorbed on alumina or silica by stabilizing surface OH groups. These groups, in association with atomically dispersed platinum, catalyzed the low-temperature WGS reaction. The active site was identified as a partially oxidized Pt-alkali-Ox(OH)y species.

The presence of MgO helps in the decomposition of formate species and minimizes carbonate formation, leading to better long-term performance in the water-gas shift reaction.
38. The addition of nickel to Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts enhances the catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. Increasing the nickel content shifts the carbon monoxide conversion-temperature curve towards lower reaction temperatures, indicating improved activity.
39. No detectable methane formation was observed during the catalytic reaction tests conducted with Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts under idealized conditions, indicating high selectivity of the catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction.
40. Increasing the reaction pressure from 0.4 MPa to 1.2 MPa raised H2 recovery from 40.5% to 89.2%, which in turn increased CO conversion from 86.0% to 95.5%.
41. Alkali promotion significantly enhances the water–gas shift activity of Pt/TiO2 catalysts by creating active sites at the metal-support interface, with an optimal alkali content (such as Na:Pt = 1:1) leading to an intrinsic activity about three times higher than the unpromoted catalyst.
42. The proposed mechanism for the water-gas shift reaction on Pt supported on ceria-based solids is a formate associative mechanism. This involves the interaction of CO adsorbed on Pt with terminal OH groups on partially reduced ceria to form formate intermediates, which then decompose to produce CO2 and H2.
43. H2S leads to a slight decline in CO conversion over Pt/CeO2 catalysts, but the catalysts retain high activity and exhibit excellent stability even with 20 ppm H2S, typical for IGCC syngas levels. The conversion was stable around 73% for a 300-hour test at 673K, indicating that after an initial decline, deactivation levels off.
44. The presence of H2S decreases the activity of Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts, with the extent of deactivation increasing with higher H2S concentrations. However, this deactivation is reversible, and catalytic activity can be largely restored when the catalysts are exposed to a reducing atmosphere without H2S.
45. The incorporation of ZrO2 into the catalyst system improved the structural properties, preventing Au particles agglomeration, leading to smaller, more uniformly distributed Au particles, thus enhancing the catalytic performance for the MT-WGS reaction. The 3% Au-CeO2 + ZrO2 catalyst achieved equilibrium conditions at about 400°C.
46. Pt–Ce/C catalysts are more active than Pt/Ce catalysts at higher temperatures (around 623K), achieving up to 90% CO conversion, while Pt/Ce catalysts achieve only 70% conversion, indicating the advantage of dispersing ceria on activated carbon for greater efficacy.
47. The proposed mechanism suggests that Pt promotes hydrogen spillover, which may interfere with H2S adsorption at oxygen vacancy sites on CeO2. This could preserve the accessibility of these sites for H2O, leading to a dynamic equilibrium of OH and SH groups. As a result, the catalytic activity of the ceria surface may be maintained in the vicinity of Pt centers, even in the presence of H2S.
48. Zirconium doping improves the pore structure of CeO2, increases the redox ability, enhances the metal dispersion, and leads to higher catalytic activity for the Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts.
49. In the realistic reformate stream, the 3% Au-CeO2 + ZrO2 catalyst achieved close to equilibrium conversion at approximately 400°C, whereas the 3% Au-CeO2 + Al2O3 did not reach equilibrium conversion and showed a maximum conversion of 37% at 330°C.
50. The Ru/V2O3 catalyst demonstrated high activity for the water gas shift reaction without producing methane when reduced at 400°C.
51. The concentration of surface formates increases with higher ceria surface area, indicating that catalysts with higher formate concentrations after CO addition show improved activities under steady state water-gas shift conditions.
52. The metal (Pt) catalyzes the reduction of the surface shell of ceria, producing active geminal OH groups on partially reduced ceria for the water-gas shift reaction, while bulk ceria is affected very little, if at all.

54. The activity and stability of the Pt/Ce0.56Zr0.44O2 catalysts were influenced by the preparation method, the type of platinum precursor used (nitrate or chloride), pretreatment atmosphere, and sintering or embedding of platinum by the support.
55. During durability testing, SCS catalysts showed deactivation due to sintering and carbonate formation, but their activity was largely recoverable upon regeneration. In contrast, the IWI catalyst made from nitrate precursors exhibited irreversible deactivation, while the IWI catalyst from chloride precursors showed a gain in activity after durability testing.
56. Pt/CeO2 nanofibers were prepared using the electrospinning method, which involved creating a spinnable sol using Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and PVP, followed by electrospinning and calcination at 400°C to obtain nanofibers composed of Pt-doped CeO2.
57. The Pt/CeO2 nanofibers showed superior catalytic activity with 98% CO conversion at 320°C, which was maintained up to 360°C, compared to pure CeO2 nanofibers and Pt-loaded CeO2 powders, making them promising for the water-gas shift reaction.
58. Electrospinning produces nanofibers with uniform distribution and particle size, addressing common issues with catalyst stability and performance, and facilitating catalyst reuse and handling compared to conventional powder catalysts.
59. The primary objective was to study the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction on Pt supported on different supports (SiO2, CeO2, TiO2) using in-situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to gain insight into the reaction mechanisms and the role of supports.
60. Pt/TiO2 catalysts were more active than both Pt/SiO2 and Pt/CeO2. The WGS reaction on Pt/TiO2 was catalyzed via a bifunctional metal-support mechanism, with Pt promoting the reduction of Ti4+ ions to Ti3+, creating oxygen vacancies for efficient water activation.
61. On Pt/CeO2 catalysts, Pt increased the concentration of OH groups by enhancing the reduction extent of ceria and provided a faster pathway for the formation of formate intermediates, contributing to a bifunctional metal-support mechanism for the WGS reaction.
62. Among CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts, Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu combinations were found to show strong synergetic promoting effects in the OWGS reaction.
63. The presence of Pd in Pd–Cu/CeO2 increases the number of active sites for H2O dissociation and suppresses H2 activation, thereby improving the catalyst’s activity in OWGS.
64. The Pd–Cu/CeO2 catalyst forms a well-mixed Pd–Cu alloy with highly dispersed Pd in Cu, which facilitates strong metal-metal interactions and enhances the OWGS activity compared to Pt–Cu/CeO2, where Pt is less miscible with Cu.
65. Doping ceria with Ca2+ enhances oxygen mobility and ceria reducibility by straining the lattice, which improves the mobility of O-bound intermediates like formates. This leads to faster migration and decomposition of intermediates, resulting in higher LT-WGS rates and turnover frequencies (TOFs).
66. Ca-doping causes a shift in diffraction peaks towards higher 2θ values and broadens the peaks, indicating lattice strain and reduction in crystallite size. This suggests successful incorporation of Ca into the ceria lattice, affecting its structure.
67. 0.5% Pt/Ca0.50Ce0.50O1.5 displays higher CO conversion and specific rates during LT-WGS than 0.5% Pt/CeO2, indicating enhanced catalytic performance. The improvement is attributed to increased oxygen mobility and surface intermediate mobility due to Ca-doping, which facilitates better interaction at the Pt-ceria interface.
68. The mesoporous titania was synthesized using a surfactant templating method through a neutral [C13(EO)6–Ti(OC3H7)4] assembly pathway.
69. The addition of ceria to mesoporous titania decreased the degree of crystallinity and particle size of the support. It also enhanced the reducibility due to the interaction between ceria and mesoporous titania.
70. Higher gold loading increased the number of active sites at the Au/ceria-modified mesoporous titania interface, leading to improved catalytic activity for the WGS reaction. The perimeter interface between Au particles and the support was emphasized as a unique reaction site.
71. Pt–ceria catalysts were prepared using the microemulsion technique.

74. The Pt/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized using the urea-nitrate combustion method.
75. The WGS activity of Pt/CeO2 catalysts depends on the nature of the dopant; the catalyst's activity varied with dopants and followed the order Yb > Gd > Zr > Mg > La > CeO2 (undoped) > Ca > Y > Zn, with Yb being the most effective dopant.
76. It is proposed that dopants enhance the reducibility by increasing the oxygen ion mobility in the ceria lattice, which facilitates oxygen transfer from the ceria to the metal, thereby affecting the surface oxygen atoms' mobility and reactivity.
77. The mixed oxide supports were prepared by coprecipitation, where aqueous solutions of metal salts were mixed, and then ammonia was added to form a precipitate, which was filtered, washed, and calcined.
78. Oxygen vacancies are thought to enhance the reducibility of the support and improve catalytic activity by facilitating oxygen mobility, which is beneficial for both the redox and associative mechanisms of the WGS reaction.
79. Doping ceria with Zr resulted in smaller particle sizes and increased surface areas, which contributed to the enhanced reducibility and potentially higher catalytic activity for the WGS reaction.
80. The addition of 3 wt% Na to the Pt/TiO2 catalyst significantly improves the water gas shift activity and stability compared to unmodified Pt/TiO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. Na helps in inhibiting Pt particle sintering, enhancing the catalyst's performance.
81. The Pt–3Na/TiO2 catalyst is stable at reaction temperatures higher than 250°C. At lower temperatures, it exhibits deactivation, likely due to the buildup of surface carbonate or formate species. However, increasing the temperature back above 250°C restores the catalyst's activity.

The mechanism behind the deactivation of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst was studied using kinetic (steady state and transient) and in situ IR spectroscopic methods, including testing the catalyst after exposure to different reactants and reaction conditions, and measuring the Pt dispersion and surface area.
88. The study concluded that strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) was not responsible for the deactivation of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst, as the SMSI effect was reversible under WGS reaction conditions and did not significantly impact the catalytic activity.

91. The purpose of considering an eggshell morphology for the Pt/CZO catalysts was to enhance platinum utilization. It was shown that a significant portion of Pt could be reduced without substantial loss of activity, especially at higher operational temperatures, by confining the active Pt to the outer shell of the catalyst particle.
92. The presence of potassium (K) as a promoter has beneficial effects under product-containing feed compositions, leading to improved CO conversion. In contrast, nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) promoters worsen the catalyst performance.

This approach allows for a better understanding of their interactions and relative significance by processing these variables separately while using them together in the model.

22. Under steady-state conditions, catalyst deactivation is primarily due to the reduction of Au and CeO2, which weakens the Au–CeO2 interaction. During shutdown/start-up operations, deactivation is mainly caused by the formation of carbonate species, particularly from the combined effect of CO2 and H2O during low-temperature shutdown and start-up steps.
23. Structural and lattice oxygen changes influence the properties of CuO/CeO2 catalysts by affecting the surface area, reducibility, oxygen storage ability, and active oxygen vacancy.

57. Cerium oxide (CeO₂) is commonly used in catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction due to its redox properties and oxygen storage capacity, which promote the reduction of CO and enhance the catalyst's performance. It stabilizes metal nanoparticles and facilitates the formation of active sites for the reaction.
58. CuO-CeO₂/Al₂O₃ catalysts offer advantages over bulk CuO-CeO₂ catalysts by providing a higher surface area that enhances the dispersion of active phases, leading to greater oxygen mobility and increased activity. The alumina support helps improve the structural properties and stability of the catalyst, resulting in a more efficient use of active materials and improved catalytic performance, especially at lower active phase loadings.
59. Au/TiO₂ catalysts are suitable for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction due to their high activity and ability to operate at lower temperatures. The interaction between gold nanoparticles and the TiO₂ support promotes the reaction, and smaller gold nanoparticle sizes (1–5 nm) are particularly effective. TiO₂ is an excellent choice for a support because of its low cost, good chemical stability, and non-toxicity. These catalysts rely on atomically dispersed gold species and surrounding surface −OH groups to catalyze the reaction effectively.
60. Pt-loaded Ce₀.₇₅Zr₀.₂₅O₂ yolk-shell microspheres offer several benefits for the water-gas shift reaction, including high catalytic activity, enhanced reducibility, and resistance to Pt sintering. The unique yolk-shell structure facilitates the dispersion of active Pt species and maintains the stability of the catalyst by preventing Pt migration and aggregation. These characteristics contribute to maintaining high CO conversion levels and catalyst stability over extended reaction times, making them effective for use in hydrogen production.
61. Mg(Al)O mixed metal oxide serves as an excellent support for Cu nanoparticles in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction due to its ability to form a solid solution with the Cu component, resulting in highly dispersed and uniform Cu nanoparticles. The support provides structural stability and resistance against sintering, which are crucial for maintaining catalyst activity and longevity. Additionally, the high dispersion of Cu nanoparticles on Mg(Al)O enhances the available active surface area, thereby increasing the WGS activity compared to traditional supports like ZnO/Al2O3. This results in a catalyst system that exhibits superior hydrogen production efficiency and stability.
62. The aging environment significantly influences the performance of Pd-based catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction. A lean-only gas environment results in less deterioration of catalyst activity compared to rich-only and redox environments, which cause severe loss of metal dispersion and catalytic activity. Pd can redisperse under dry lean conditions, such as 700°C air exposure, which helps restore catalytic function by forming PdO, allowing it to spread and fragment into smaller particles. This redispersion is particularly effective for Pd supported on La-Al2O3 and Ce-ZrO2 oxides, enhancing catalyst activity by restoring the metal-support interface sites needed for efficient CO conversion. This insight can inform engine control strategies to periodically regenerate catalysts and maintain their performance.

64. Adding 0.5 mol.% lanthanum to Cu-Mn catalysts significantly improves the catalyst's activity for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction. The improvement is attributed to the uniform distribution of Cu and Mn components and enhanced dispersion of Cu on the catalyst's surface, facilitated by the synergistic effect between Cu and Mn.
65. Aluminum foam in structured catalysts serves as a high thermal conductivity carrier, improving heat transfer across the catalytic bed. This leads to a more uniform temperature profile, enhancing CO conversion by increasing inlet temperature and reducing outlet temperature, thereby optimizing reaction kinetics and overcoming the kinetic and thermodynamic limits of typical packed bed reactors.
66. Using Anderson-type CoMo heteropolyanion as a precursor leads to a strong interaction between Co and Mo species, which facilitates an easier deep reduction of Mo oxides and enhances the formation of active Co-Mo-S sites.

67. The most effective method for preparing Cu-based Mg-Al layered double oxide catalysts for the water gas shift reaction in the study was co-precipitation (CP). The catalyst prepared by the CP method, specifically Cu0.15Mg3Al-CP300, exhibited the highest catalytic activity, attributed to its lower reduction temperatures, higher BET surface area, and enhanced dispersion of active sites compared to those prepared by the other methods.
68. Alkali promoters, such as sodium, modify the electronic structure of formate species by weakening the C–H bond, facilitating its decomposition. This leads to enhanced activity of Pt/silica catalysts in the water-gas shift and steam-assisted formic acid decomposition reactions. A normal kinetic isotope effect was observed for both reactions, with a decrease in magnitude upon Na-doping, suggesting formate C–H bond breaking as the rate-limiting step in an associative mechanism. The alkali dopants also promote the formation of reactive OH groups, aiding the catalytic cycle without producing stable carbonates that could suppress it.
69. The Ni-doped mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic performance for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction, with CO conversion of 93% and 47% H2 yield at 280 °C. This enhanced activity is attributed to the smaller crystallite size (8.6 nm) of the catalyst and the strong interaction between Co and Ni, which leads to higher reducibility of Co3O4 and increased oxygen vacancy concentration on the catalyst surface.
70. Potassium doping enhances the catalytic activity and stability of mesoporous Pd/TiO2 catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction by increasing the dispersion of Pd and preventing sintering of Pd particles. The alkali metal promotes electron transfer, stabilizing Pd in a partially oxidized state and creating more surface hydroxyl groups, which are beneficial for the reaction. Additionally, potassium suppresses methanation, leading to higher selectivity toward the water-gas shift reaction.
71. Doping Ru/AC catalysts with potassium salts, particularly K2CO3, significantly enhances their catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The presence of potassium salts decreases the reduction temperature of RuOx, weakens the interaction between RuOx and the support, and increases the local concentration of water around active sites due to the hygroscopic nature of potassium salts. This improved interaction between Ru and reactant molecules (CO and H2O) leads to higher catalytic activity. Additionally, the method of potassium salt incorporation affects catalyst activity, with post-treatment of pre-formed Ru/AC being more effective than pre-treatment of the carbon support with K2CO3.
72. The addition of cobalt to Cu-CeO2 catalysts enhances the structural properties and catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction by forming Co2O3 and Co3O4 species, which provide additional CO adsorption sites. This modification increases CO conversion and the thermal stability of the catalyst. Additionally, the presence of cobalt increases Lewis and Brønsted acid site densities, facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO and H2 molecules, resulting in improved catalytic activity.
73. Bimetallic Pt/M/CeZrO4 catalysts (where M includes Na, Mo, Sn, Cu, Zn) offer benefits over monometallic Pt/CeZrO4 catalysts for the low temperature water-gas shift reaction by reducing methanation, leading to higher hydrogen selectivity. These bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn/CeZrO4 and Pt/Na/CeZrO4, demonstrated similar or better CO conversion yet had higher hydrogen selectivity because less CO and hydrogen were consumed in methane production. Additionally, introducing a second metal helps to enhance catalyst performance, potentially by modifying electronic properties, stability, and interaction with the support.

- These catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity than traditional systems, achieving more than 95% CO conversion at just 393 K, which is at least one order of magnitude higher than previously reported catalysts for similar temperature ranges.
- The α-MoC substrate helps in achieving high dispersion and altered electronic structure of the supported Au, which facilitates favorable bonding with CO and efficient activation of water at low temperatures.
- The Au/α-MoC catalyst shows remarkable stability up to 473 K without oxidation of α-MoC or aggregation of Au.
- Synergistic interactions between Au and adjacent Mo sites on α-MoC facilitate low-temperature water activation and subsequent CO reactions with surface hydroxyl groups, leading to exceptional catalytic performance.
75. The main advantage of using non-thermal plasma activation for the water-gas shift reaction in this study is that it allows the reaction to occur at low temperatures, overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, while maintaining high catalytic activity. This is achieved through structural changes in the gold-based catalyst that do not occur with traditional thermal activation, leading to a weakening of the AuCO bond and an alternative reaction pathway.
76. Gold (Au) is used in catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction due to its ability to enhance catalytic activity, particularly under non-thermal plasma activation conditions. It facilitates the reaction at lower temperatures by undergoing structural changes that lead to a weakening of the AuCO bond, promoting an alternative reaction pathway and maintaining high catalytic efficiency.
77. Pd single atoms in the Pd/FeOx catalyst enhance the reducibility of FeOx and facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which serve as active sites for promoting the dissociation of H2O into H2 and atomic O. These atomic oxygen species readily react with CO adsorbed on Pd single-atom sites, promoting a redox mechanism that results in low activation energy and high catalytic efficiency.
78. The dispersion of Pd species as single atoms in Pd/FeOx catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The high dispersion increases the turnover frequency due to the increased availability of active sites. Single-atom dispersion weakens the CO adsorption, promoting its reaction with H2O and leading to higher atomic efficiency and a lower activation energy, compared to larger Pd clusters or nanoparticles.
79. Citric acid (CA) acts as a chelating agent that promotes the dispersion of platinum (Pt) on the support in Pt-based catalysts. By chelating with Pt ions, CA helps maintain the separation of Pt atoms, preventing agglomeration during the drying process. This results in better distribution of Pt on the support, leading to enhanced dispersion and smaller Pt nanoparticle sizes. The improved dispersal of Pt allows for more active catalytic sites, better thermal stability, and enhanced catalytic performance, particularly in eliminating pollutants in vehicle exhaust.
80. Ni/Mo/TiO2 offers several advantages over Co/Mo/Al2O3 in the water-gas shift reaction. Ni/Mo/TiO2 operates effectively at lower temperatures, with reaction starting temperatures below 200°C, compared to Co/Mo/Al2O3, which starts above 250°C. Ni/Mo/TiO2 also achieves higher CO conversions under low steam-to-CO ratios, showing a maximum CO conversion at a H2O/CO ratio of 1.2 mol/mol. Furthermore, Ni/Mo/TiO2 exhibits greater sulfur tolerance and higher activity for COS conversion and HCN decomposition, making it more efficient under industrial coal gasification conditions with low steam and high sulfur content. Additionally, Ni/Mo/TiO2 requires less catalyst quantity to achieve similar conversions when compared to Co/Mo/Al2O3, making it more economical.
81. The benefit of using a copper supported on zeolite 13X hybrid material for the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) lies in its ability to enhance the reaction by capturing CO2 in situ, known as sorption enhanced water-gas shift reaction (SE-WGSR). This process maximizes hydrogen production by shifting equilibrium to favor more CO conversion through CO2 removal during the reaction. The Cu-zeolite 13X hybrid material exhibits high catalytic activity, achieving up to 95% CO conversion, and during SE-WGSR tests, it resulted in higher concentrations of hydrogen, with improvements noticed in both transient and steady-state operation. The material effectively integrates reaction and separation, resulting in more efficient hydrogen production at low temperatures.
82. The Ni/Mo/TiO2 catalyst enhances the efficiency of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process with CO2 capture by operating effectively at low temperatures and low steam-to-CO ratios. This sulfur-tolerant catalyst allows for reduced steam usage in the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, thus preserving more steam for power generation in the steam turbine. As a result, the catalyst contributes to an improvement in net thermal efficiency. The study found that when the Ni/Mo/TiO2 catalyst was applied, the net thermal efficiency improved by 0.8 percentage points compared to higher steam requirements, achieving a net efficiency of 40.0% (HHV). This efficiency improvement makes the catalyst highly suitable for integration into IGCC systems with carbon capture, as it enhances power production while minimizing CO2 emissions.
83. The size of Pt has a significant impact on its catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction when supported on FeOx. Pt single-atoms (Pt-SAC) on FeOx show significantly higher specific activity and turnover frequency (TOF) compared to Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP). Pt-SACs have a lower activation energy (33 kJ/mol), facilitating a more efficient "redox" mechanism where CO reacts with oxygen generated from H2O dissociation at the oxygen vacancies of FeOx, promoting higher CO conversion rates. In contrast, Pt-NP exhibits a stronger CO adsorption and higher activation energy, favoring an "associative" mechanism where CO reacts with OH groups formed from H2O activation, leading to the formation and decomposition of formate intermediates, resulting in simultaneous production of H2 and CO2 but with reduced activity and greater energy demand. The study highlights Pt-SACs as highly active for WGS due to their ability to effectively catalyze through a "redox" pathway and achieve superior conversion performance even at low Pt loadings.
84. Varying the Cu content in Cu-Fe3O4 catalysts significantly affects their performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. The study finds an optimal Cu-Fe ratio, with Cu0.3Fe0.7Ox exhibiting the highest catalytic activity due to enhanced Cu dispersion and strong Cu-Fe interactions. This leads to increased active surface area and better reducibility, facilitating higher CO adsorption and conversion rates. An excessive amount of Cu results in sintering and deactivation, reducing catalyst stability and performance. Conversely, low Cu content results in insufficient active sites and too strong CO adsorption, also lowering WGS activity. Thus, optimizing Cu content is critical for balancing active phase availability with catalyst stability, achieving high WGS activity at low temperatures. The addition of Fe improves catalyst reducibility and stability, enhancing WGS performance by promoting desired adsorptive and reductive properties on the catalyst surface.

This enhancement facilitated improved CO chemisorption and increased the reducibility of the ceria support, thereby favoring the water-splitting reaction in the water-gas shift process. The plasma treatment, in combination with hydrogen reduction, produced catalysts with superior activity compared to conventional treatments.
90. The new catalyst design concept proposed for the WGS reaction involves using a physical mixture of a traditional WGS catalyst (such as those based on Cu, Pt, or Au) with an ionic conductor. The role of the ionic conductor is to enhance the catalyst's performance by facilitating the dissociation and transport of water, thereby improving the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This is achieved through the ionic conductor's ability to act as an active water species supplier, leveraging proton conductivity via the Grotthuss mechanism to improve the overall water activation.
91. Yttrium doping in Au/CeO2 catalysts increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies and enhances oxygen ion mobility, which can improve the ionic conductivity and catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction. However, excessive yttrium (beyond a certain limit) can lead to reduced surface ionic conductivity and hinder oxygen ion mobility due to vacancy ordering. For lightly yttrium-doped catalysts (1 and 2.5 mass% Y2O3), increased oxygen mobility correlates with higher catalytic activity, as demonstrated by better CO conversion, particularly in catalysts prepared by impregnation.
92. The choice of precipitant significantly impacts the structural properties, Pt dispersion, and catalytic activity of the pt/0.1Al-0.9Ce catalysts. NH4OH as a precipitant resulted in catalysts with the highest CO oxidation activity, largest oxygen vacancy, and highest Pt dispersion. Catalysts prepared with hydroxide-form precipitants (e.g., NH4OH, KOH, NaOH) showed better catalytic performance than those prepared with carbonate-form precipitants (e.g., K2CO3, Na2CO3) due to better Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility. The study concluded that the catalytic activity was closely related to the oxygen vacancy and Pt dispersion, with NH4OH being identified as the most effective precipitant under the experimental conditions.
93. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst prepared using the Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) method exhibited superior performance in the water-gas shift reaction compared to a catalyst made from commercial ceria nanopowder. The SAS-derived catalyst had a higher reducibility, more oxygen vacancies, and better platinum dispersion, leading to higher CO conversion rates. The different nanoparticle shape and size modulation through the SAS method likely resulted in enhanced catalytic properties due to improved support-metal interaction and increased oxygen storage capacity. These factors contributed to the SAS-derived catalyst demonstrating optimal performance, particularly at temperatures above 280°C.
94. The Ce0.6Y0.4O2-supported platinum catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction due to several factors:
- High Reducibility: The introduction of yttria (Y2O3) into the CeO2 lattice increases the reducibility of the support, enhancing oxygen mobility and facilitating the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the water-gas shift reaction.
- Oxygen Vacancy Creation: The Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support has a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, providing more reactive sites for the reaction and improving the reducibility and catalytic performance at low temperatures.
- Improved Interaction and Redox Properties: The interaction between Pt and the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support improves the redox properties of the catalyst, favoring the formation of active hydroxyl groups, which are essential for enhancing the activity of the water-gas shift reaction.
- Reduction in CO Adsorption Strength: The Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst reduces the strength of CO adsorption, preventing blockage of active sites and thereby improving the rate of reaction and overall catalytic activity. These factors together contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst compared to Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 catalysts, which exhibit lower reducibility and fewer oxygen vacancies.
95. The Pt/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated superior water-gas shift activity compared to other mono-metallic PGM catalysts supported on CeO2 and TiO2. It exhibited higher CO conversion rates and showed no methanation below 300°C, making it more desirable for fuel processing. In contrast, Rh-based catalysts, like Rh/TiO2 and Rh/CeO2, led to significant methanation, making them less suitable. Although Pt/CeO2 showed excellent initial activity, it deactivated substantially over time, indicating a need for further development to improve stability for commercial applications. Lower Pt loadings yielded higher specific metal activity, which is beneficial for cost efficiency.
96. The synthesis method used was co-precipitation.
97. Yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) is used as a dopant in Au/CeO₂ catalysts to modify the ceria support, enhancing oxygen vacancy formation and improving the catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction. However, an increase in Y₂O₃ content may hinder oxygen mobility due to the ordering of surface vacancies near segregated Y³⁺ ions, affecting catalyst activity.
98. The synthesis method used was a metal-organic framework (MOF) templated approach. This involved the formation of CuCe-BTC MOF followed by a two-step heat treatment to produce nanoporous Cu/CeO₂ nanostructures.
99. The optimal aging conditions for the synthesis of Al₂O₃ supported Cu-Zn catalysts using co-precipitation were an aging temperature of 80°C and an aging time of 72 hours. These conditions resulted in the highest CO conversion and very stable catalytic activity, attributed to high surface area and an almost complete degree of CuO reduction.
100. Thin LaCoO₃ films prepared by atomic layer deposition serve as supports for platinum catalysts, retaining high Pt dispersion after redox cycling and showing high activity for CO oxidation and the water gas shift reaction. The perovskite structure is crucial, influencing catalytic behavior and offering a stable support that aids in maintaining the active metal dispersion even after high-temperature treatments.
101. Ceria-titania (Ce₁₋ₓTiₓO₂) offers enhanced activity and stability for gold catalysts in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction compared to ceria-zirconia. The advantages include a higher specific surface area and a greater density of oxygen defect sites, which contribute to better dispersion and stabilization of gold species. This leads to improved catalytic performance and prolonged catalyst life under reaction conditions.
102. Manganese doping in inverse CeO₂/CuO catalysts enhances their performance in the water-gas shift reaction by influencing the characteristics of supported ceria particles. This doping reduces the size of ceria particles and increases their reducibility, thereby enhancing water activation and the generation of active intermediates. These changes lead to a higher intrinsic activity of the catalytically active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance for the water-gas shift reaction.
103. In the Pt/γ-Mo₂N catalyst, molybdenum species on the catalyst surface largely exist as molybdenum oxide (MoO₃). This surface MoO₃ is highly reducible even at room temperature and transforms into highly distorted MoOx species during the water-gas shift reaction, which significantly contributes to the catalyst's activity and stability. The interaction and transformation of these molybdenum species on the surface are crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction.
104. Noble metals supported on binary γ-Al₂O₃-α-Ga₂O₃ oxide show varying performances in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction, with Pd/AlGa exhibiting the highest catalytic activity among the tested catalysts. Despite Pt/AlGa demonstrating the highest metal dispersion, the presence of isolated palladium species on the Pd/AlGa catalyst, which are electronically less saturated and more active, is believed to contribute significantly to its superior performance. Therefore, the catalytic activity in this system is less dependent on metal dispersion and more influenced by the presence of isolated active metal species.
105. Lanthana modification in Pt/La(x)/HAP catalysts enhances several properties critical for the water-gas shift reaction. The addition of lanthana increases oxygen storage capacity, inhibits the incorporation of Pt into the HAP framework, promotes reducibility, and results in smaller Pt particle sizes. These changes improve the catalysts' activity and stability. The Pt/La(x)/HAP catalysts show high resistance to shut-down/start-up cycles due to these modifications, making them suitable for potential mobile device applications. The reaction demonstrated similarities to the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in terms of reaction orders, suggesting that lanthana introduction enhances kinetics akin to non-reducible supports.
